## üöÄ Key Features

- **Question Modeling:**  
  Supports both Multiple Choice (`MCQ`) and True/False (`TF`) questions, inheriting from a base `Question` class with properties for header, body, mark, and answers.

- **Flexible Exam Types:**  
  The application supports two distinct exam formats:
  - **Final Exam:** A comprehensive test including both `MCQ` and `TF` questions.
  - **Practical Exam:** A focused test containing only `MCQ` questions.

- **Answer Management:**  
  A dedicated `Answer` class to handle answer options, correct answer validation, and result evaluation.

- **Extensible Exam Structure:**  
  A base `Exam` class defines common attributes (time, number of questions). Subclasses (`FinalExam`, `PracticalExam`) provide specific implementations for how the exam is displayed and graded.

- **Subject Association:**  
  Each exam is logically linked to a `Subject`, allowing for organized exam creation and management per subject.

- **Clear Result Display:**  
  - **Practical Exam:** Provides immediate feedback by showing correct answers after completion.
  - **Final Exam:** Delivers a summary including all questions, user answers, and the final grade.
